# UvA Deep Learning Course - Practicals

## Environments
We provide a conda environment called `dl2020` which contains all packages you might need for the course (practicals and tutorials). For your own computer, use the file [`environment.yml`](https://github.com/uvadlc/uvadlc_practicals_2020/blob/master/environment.yml) to create the environment. For your account on Lisa, please use the file [`environment_Lisa.yml`](https://github.com/uvadlc/uvadlc_practicals_2020/blob/master/environment_Lisa.yml) which installs the environment `dl2020` with CUDA 10.1 support.
